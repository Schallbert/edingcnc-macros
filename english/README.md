# SPINOGY X22 Macros for Eding CNC

SPINOGY macros for Eding CNC add two functions to the software, specifically adapted to the X22 spindles. With the warm-up and grease distribution run routines, the spindles are prepared for use exactly according to the manufacturer's plans.

Depending on the downtime or storage time and the storage or mounting position, a corresponding warmup or grease distribution run must be performed with the spindle. This ensures uniform bearing lubrication, which results in the bearing temperature being low, thus increasing grease and bearing life.

For more information, please refer to the operating instructions of your X22 spindle.
